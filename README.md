# middleman
a trusted machine that does things for you and other people

# how it works
for something to be added to the ledger (the list of machine code/processes that were run/started),
everyone must have signed off on it happening (global concensus).

# determinism
all machine code must have deterministic effects on the state

# state dump
the machine also dumps its state periodically for readability. The state is, however, rederivable from the ledger and executing the machine in a deterministic way.
